## Future Scope 

Though it is easy to create Chrome extensions, on the technical front, creating a Chrome extension is more or less like building a web page. But this doesn’t apply to the feel and experiences, i.e., the user experience and user interface that the extension is expected to provide. It is important that we draw a line of difference as every extension is here to serve a different use case or purpose. While some extensions are here to add UI to Chrome browser, known as page or browser actions – any Chrome extension can serve either one browser action or one-page action.
